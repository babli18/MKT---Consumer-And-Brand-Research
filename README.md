**Notebook Contents**
======================

1. **K-Means Clustering (stp_kmeans.ipynb):**
   - Demonstrates the implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm for customer segmentation.
   - Visualizes how data points are grouped based on shared characteristics, providing actionable insights for marketing strategies.

2. **Linear Discriminant Analysis (stp_lda.ipynb):**
   - Explores Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for classifying data points.
   - Focuses on GPA and GMAT scores to predict college admission status (Admit/Reject).
   - Explains the step-by-step process of using LDA for binary classification problems.

3. **Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) (stp_nmds.ipynb):**
   - Showcases Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) for visualizing data in reduced dimensions.
   - Highlights how MDS can be used to reveal underlying patterns in complex datasets.

4. **Regression Analysis (stp_regression.ipynb):**
   - Provides an overview of regression techniques using the `scikit-learn` and `statsmodels` libraries.
   - Discusses the differences between the libraries and their use cases for prediction versus statistical inference.
   - Includes examples of linear and multiple regression to model relationships between variables.

5. **Logistic Regression (logit.ipynb):**
   - Implements logistic regression using the Statsmodels library to analyze college admissions data.
   - Explains how logistic regression can predict binary outcomes and interpret feature weights.
   - Emphasizes statistical inference with p-values, confidence intervals, and detailed output for better decision-making.
